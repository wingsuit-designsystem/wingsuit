        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        <p class="lead">Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been
          a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.</p>
          <h2>Heading 2</h2>
          <p>By default, Tailwind
          removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful
          for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you <em>really are</em>
          just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising
          and unintuitive.</p>
          <h3>Heading 3</h3>
          <p>We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:</p>
          <h4>Heading 4</h4>
          <p>We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:</p>
          <h5>Heading 5</h5>
          <p>We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:</p>
          <h2>Ol Lists</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Nested lists are rarely a good idea.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>You might feel like you are being really "organized" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on
                the screen that is hard to read.
              </li>
              <li>Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.</li>
              <li>Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Since we need to have more items, here is another one.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>I am not sure if we will bother styling more than two levels deep.</li>
              <li>Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.</li>
              <li>If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Two items is not really a list, three is good though.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Again please do not nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.</li>
              <li>Nobody wants to look at this.</li>
              <li>I am upset that we even have to bother styling this.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol><p>The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that elements are not given a child
          tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about
          styling that annoying situation too.</p>
        <h2>UL Lists</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>For example, here is another nested list.</strong></p>
            <p>But this time with a second paragraph.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>These list items wont have <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags</li>
              <li>Because they are only one line each</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>But in this second top-level list item, they will.</strong></p>
            <p>This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>As you can see here, because I have added a second line, this list item now has a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
                tag.</p>
                <p>This is the second line I am talking about by the way.</p></li>
              <li><p>Finally here is another list item so it is more like a list.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><p>A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?</p></li>
        </ul><p>And finally a sentence to close off this section.</p><h2>There are other elements we need to style</h2><p>I
          almost forgot to mention links, like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">this link to the Tailwind CSS website</a>. We
          almost made them blue but that is so yesterday, so we went with purple, feels edgier.</p><p>We even included table
