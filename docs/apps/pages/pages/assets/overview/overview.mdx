# Overview

Wingsuit will compile all assets, which are `@import`ed inside the design system or your `apps/[app]/assets.js`.

If you are missing an asset inside your `dist` folder or your webpack auto-reload is not working, check if this file is `@import`ed.

You can configure the dist folder in your `wingsuit.conf.yml`. The default points `[root]/dist/app-[type]`:
```js
  apps: {
    storybook: {
      ...
      distFolder: 'dist/app-storybook',
      ...
    },
```
The asset preset compiles every asset to a separate output folder inside your `dist` folder.
